NonRotatingShooter
==================
Implements and simulates an algorithm for a non-rotating shooter to launch a projectile that strikes a target. 

The algorithm for hitting a moving target with constant velocity is based on the solution of a quardratic equation in the time
for the bullet to reach the target.

This code base contains the algorithm implementation as a simple function, along with a simulation of the target moving and
the shooter for experimentation.
